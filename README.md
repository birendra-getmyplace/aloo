# Aloo - the base to your *torkari* (project).

An easy starting point with NodeJS, ExpressJS, SASS, ReactJS and Redux. Includes testing and docker integration for cross OS development.

## Why Aloo instead of other stacks?

- Watching throughout development, both client and server. Testing too! Dramatically speeds up development.
- Easily plug in any DB of choice
- Docker integration for cross OS development
- ES6 to leverage the latest JavaScript features
- SASSify your stylesheets
- ReactJS server side rendering with Redux for state management

## Things to do

- Documentation
